# IOTA Node Dashboard

Programmed using modern web technologies.

### Dashboard in dev mode (HORNET)

1. Make sure to set `dashboard.dev` to true, to enable HORNET to serve assets
   from the webpack-dev-server.
2. Install all needed npm modules via `yarn install`.
3. Run a webpack-dev-server instance by running `yarn start` within the repo root directory.
4. Using default port config, you should now be able to access the dashboard under http://127.0.0.1:8081

The dashboard is hot-reload enabled.
